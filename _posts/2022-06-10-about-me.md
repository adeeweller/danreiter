Dr. Dan Reiter is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Political Science at Emory University.  His scholarly interests include interstate conflict, gender and international relations, civil-military relations, alliances, military effectiveness, public opinion and foreign policy, war termination, and others.  He earned his B.A. in political science from Northwestern University in 1989, his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan in 1994, and was a post-doctoral fellow at the John M. Olin Institute at Harvard University from 1994-1995.  In 2002, he was given the Karl Deutsch Award from the International Studies Association, presented annually to a scholar under age 40 or within ten years of having received the Ph.D. “who is judged to have made (through a body of publications) the most significant contribution to the study of International Relations and Peace Research.” <br />  <br />

Dr. Reiter has written three books, [Crucible of Beliefs: Learning, Alliances, and World Wars](https://www.amazon.com/Crucible-Beliefs-Learning-Alliances-Security/dp/0801431883) (Cornell, 1996), [Democracies at War](https://www.amazon.com/Democracies-at-War-Dan-Reiter/dp/0691089493/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538355928&sr=1-1&keywords=democracies+at+war) (with Allan C. Stam; Princeton, 2002), and [How Wars End](https://www.amazon.com/Democracies-at-War-Dan-Reiter/dp/0691089493/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538355928&sr=1-1&keywords=democracies+at+war) (Princeton 2009). How Wars End earned the American Political Science Award for the best book in conflict processes published over two years.  Dr. Reiter has also published dozens of scholarly articles and is the editor of [The Sword’s Other Edge: Tradeoffs in the Pursuit of Military Effectiveness](https://www.amazon.com/Swords-Other-Edge-Trade-offs-Effectiveness/dp/1108404138/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538355987&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Sword%E2%80%99s+Other+Edge%3A+Tradeoffs+in+the+Pursuit+of+Military+Effectiveness). <br />  <br />

Dr. Reiter is the editor of a path-breaking new international relations textbook, [Understanding War and Peace](https://www.understandingwarandpeace.com/). This textbook contains new chapters written for undergraduates on key topics in the study of international relations, including the bargaining model of war, civil wars, public opinion, weapons of mass destruction, alliances, peacekeeping and mediation, and others.  The chapters are all written by leading scholars.  The book is available online, and students can buy chapters individually.  This means that students only need to buy those chapters that are assigned by their instructors, keeping textbook costs down.<br />  <br />



<!-- You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
