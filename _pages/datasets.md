These are data sets that I and my various coauthors have produced, also accessible through the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/dreiter).

"Interstate Alliances, 1985-1992" (pdf)

This is not a machine-readable data set, but rather a document that describes changes in alliances from 1985-1992. It is meant to be used as a tool for updating the Correlates of War alliances data set, which codes alliances from 1816-1984.
